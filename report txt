 
 What I Changed:

# To optimize the grocery store simulation, I made a few important changes.
# I reduced the number of checkers from five to two, which made the checkout
# process more efficient without having too much idle time. I also made
# customer arrival times random between one and two minutes instead of exactly
# every two minutes, which made the simulation more realistic. I adjusted how
# shoppers picked the number of items by using a weighted random choice, so
# most shoppers would buy between 10 and 15 items.

# What I Learned:
# 
# From this simulation, I learned how important it is to balance the number of
# workers with customer demand in real-world systems. If there are not enough
# checkers, customer wait times become too long. If there are too many checkers,
# a lot of time is wasted with workers standing around. I also learned that
# adding small amounts of randomness, like in customer arrivals and shopping
# speed, makes the simulation feel more realistic.
